# An-Enhancing-Comprehensive-ML-Framework-for-DDoS-Defense-through-Leveraging-Multiple-Algorithms

*A DDoS attack occurs when malicious actors strategically flood a target system, such as a website or network, with an overwhelming volume of traffic. This flood of traffic, originating from a multitude of sources distributed across the internet, is intended to exceed the target system's capacity to handle requests. The ultimate consequence is a debilitating disruption of normal services, rendering the targeted system inaccessible to legitimate users.
*The motivations behind DDoS attacks vary widely, ranging from ideological activism and competitive rivalry to cybercrime and extortion. Hacktivists may employ DDoS attacks as a means of protest or to amplify their digital presence, while criminal actors may launch such attacks to distract from other malicious activities or to extort businesses for financial gain.
*As organizations increasingly rely on their online presence, safeguarding against DDoS attacks becomes paramount. Addressing this threat involves a strategic utilization of organizational assets, particularly within the framework of websites and online infrastructures.
*By incorporating KNN, SVM, Gaussian, and Naive Bayes, the paper aims to enhance the overall predictive performance of the model. The observed significant improvement in defect determination accuracy, when compared to existing research, underscores the efficacy of the integrated model in addressing the dynamic and evolving landscape of DDoS attacks.
*In summary, this project contributes to the field of DDoS mitigation by advocating for the use of the latest data and employing a sophisticated integrated model. The results showcase promising advancements in predicting and classifying DDoS attacks.
